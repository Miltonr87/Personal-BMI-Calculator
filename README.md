### About

Made entirely in SPA style with Vanilla JS, the calculator uses as a standard method developed by WHO (World Health Organization), which takes into account specificities such as gender and year of birth (in this case, using the table of Brazilian people). So, the calculation goes beyond ordinary BMI calculators and identifies the user's profile (child, young or elderly) and indicates the health situation of each personal profile.
